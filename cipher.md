Let's break down the line key[key_index % len(key)]:

key: This is the string 'python' that we established earlier.
key_index: This is an integer variable that keeps track of the current position in the key string.
%: This is the modulus operator, which returns the remainder of the division of key_index by len(key).
len(key): This returns the length of the key string, which is 6 in this case (since 'python' has 6 characters).
So, what's happening here is that key_index is being used to index into the key string, but with a twist. The % operator ensures that key_index wraps around to the beginning of the string when it reaches the end.

Here's an example of how this works:

key_index is 0, so key[key_index % len(key)] returns the first character of the string, 'p'.
key_index is 1, so key[key_index % len(key)] returns the second character of the string, 'y'.
key_index is 2, so key[key_index % len(key)] returns the third character of the string, 't'.
...
key_index is 5, so key[key_index % len(key)] returns the sixth character of the string, 'n'.
key_index is 6, so key[key_index % len(key)] returns the first character of the string again, 'p', because 6 % 6 = 0.
This wrapping behavior is what allows the Vigen√®re cipher to reuse the key string for longer messages.
